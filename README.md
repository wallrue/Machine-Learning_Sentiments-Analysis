# NTUST_Machine-Learning_Final-project: Sentiments Analysis

## Introduction

This is repository for final project of Machine Learning course. The description of project is here.

## Description

We aim to analyze the sentiments of two databases: the sentiment database from Stanford and the sentiment database from UCI.

To analyze the sentiment databases and make a comparison between the results, we used three kinds of models: LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and BERT.

## How to Run

Download ['preprocessed_data'](https://mega.nz/file/BrFBCCrB#PnQUJORmfO2vcUg4xd4m1i0jyOKoQlt8hpRSegAOVzs) and paste them to the main folder *.ipynb files. 

Because those files were executed on Google Colab, we should copy those files and paste them to the 'My Drive' folder of Google Drive.
* Run the file LSTM_BiLSTM.ipynb to use LSTM and Bi-LSTM for sentiment analysis on the Stanford and UCI sentiment databases.
* Run the file BERT.ipynb to use BERT for sentiment analysis on the Stanford and UCI sentiment databases.
