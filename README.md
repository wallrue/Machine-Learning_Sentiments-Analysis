# NTUST_Machine-Learning_Final-project: Sentiments Analysis

## Introduction

This is repository for final project of Machine Learning course. The description of project is here.

## Description

We aim to analyze the sentiments of two databases: the sentiment database from Stanford and the sentiment database from UCI.

To analyze the sentiment databases and make a comparison between the results, we used three kinds of models: LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and BERT.

## How to Run

Pre-process data: run /Preprocess/preprocess.py to create the 'preprocessed_data' for LSTM and Bi-LSTM. Then, we move 'preprocessed_data' to '/GoogleColab/RNN' folder.

Because those files were executed on Google Colab, we should upload those files to the 'My Drive' folder of Google Drive:
* Upload those files in '/GoogleColab/RNN' to the 'My Drive' folder of Google Drive for using LSTM and Bi-LSTM to analyze sentiments on the Stanford and UCI sentiment databases.
* Upload those files in '/GoogleColab/bert_classify' to the 'My Drive' folder of Google Drive for using BERT to analyze sentiments on the Stanford and UCI sentiment databases.
